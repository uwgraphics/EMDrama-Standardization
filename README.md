# EMDrama-Standardization

This repository contains standardization information for the Early Modern Drama
corpus. It contains tag and annotation files for the 1292 works.
 See the [README for the corpus](https://github.com/uwgraphics/EMDrama) for
more information.

These files are really only useful for the SlimTV text viewer. They can be accessed
using the "Standarization View Link"  option in the
[Metadata Builder](https://uwgraphics.github.io/MetadataBuilder/).
